I think my biggest challenge was combining my 
ppm framework with the shape code. I had to make edits to
the ways I accessed both to bring it in line with the 
requirements and with the new code.

I reworked most of my code to be reference based so I could
easily draw in the pixels I needed to.

I really liked this assignment because it was satisfying combining
multiple projects to make something new.
