DUE ON 5/20

You will read a set of numbers from a file. The file name will be give by commandline input. You are then to calculate the minimum and maximum values of by summing 1 less than the set of number. You will then print the two values, first the minimum then the maximum with exactly one space between them. ex. 10 11

As an example:
Suppose the file contains the following:
5
1 2 3 4 5

5 is the number of integers that will be read in. You will calculate the min max of the remaining numbers. 

1.  2+3+4+5 = 14 
2. 1+3+4+5 = 13
3. 1+2+4+5 = 12
4. 1+2+3+5 = 11
5. 1+2+3+4 = 10

Given the above results the min would be 10 and max would be 14, therefore your program should print:
10 14


Your job is to implement the findMinMax function.
