DUE ON 5/25

For this assignment, you will be given an input sting, and you will need to encrypt it into another string.

The encryption method works like this: You will be given a sentance with no spaces in it. You must use this string to build a matrix such that the floor of the square root of the length of the string is the number of rows in the matrix and the ceiling of the square root of the length of the string is the number of columns. Once you have built this matrix, you will need to read down each column and print the letters, and print a space at the end of each column.

 

For example:

haveaniceday has length 12. Sqrt(12) = 3.4. So the 3x4 matrix is as follows:

h a v e
a n i c
e d a y

Reading down the columns you get: "hae and via ecy" This should be the string that you print.
