My first problem was thinking too linearly in reguards to the class structure.
I then made the choice to create an object which would contain the object
because the collage would be made of multiple images.

I used inspiration from most photo editors like photoshop who allow you to make
edits, and allow multiple layers on the same image. However, at time of export
it requires that you flatten into one layer which now makes more sense to me.
