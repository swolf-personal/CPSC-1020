I encountered a mess of errors with my resize function that launched
me into an epic multi day conquest. Only after hours of relentless struggle
did the TAs help me discover I had the height and width params mixed around.
So that was fun.

Overall I did like this project. I think I prefer to have a larger project
over a longer time because it is more rewarding to finish. Especially now
that I have been able to add my lab7 makefile.
