My first problem was thinking too linearly in reguards to the class structure.
I then made the choice to create an object which would contain the object
because the collage would be made of multiple images.

I used inspiration from most photo editors like photoshop who allow you to make
edits, and allow multiple layers on the same image. However, at time of export
it requires that you flatten into one layer which now makes more sense to me.

Then I encountered the mess of errors with my resize function that launched
me into an epic multi day conquest. Only after hours of relentless struggle
did the TAs help me discover I had the height and width params mixed around.
So that was fun.
